# News Game Submission

```
What are The Goals of This Project?
```
I hope to make people more aware of the current climate of law enforcement through structured questions and plan to include real scenarios that made it into the news, but not all may be aware of them.  Each and every year too many officers that are poorly trained or have been badly influenced by their superiors are killing people who should not have died.  That is not saying all of the people who died are innocent, but the use of deadly force can violate the 4th amendment rights of individuals depending on the scenario.  Through the game I would like it to spread awareness not only to make people aware, but to possibly give people the knowledge if they are ever faced in a situation where they are in uniform and they have to make that split second decision.

How will Players Play This Game?
```
With this project I am going to create a fully text based game that will print a situation on the screen that the user will read and will have to choose from one of two options which will be selected by either hitting “1” or “2”.  The idea of the situations will place the player in the shoes of a police officer in a situation where they will choose to use deadly force or if they will explore another option (non-lethal options such as a taser).  Depending on the choice the player makes I will then return with factual information based upon current police in our country.  If a player answers too many of these prompts incorrectly the game will then restart and let the player know why certain answers were incorrect.  While this could quickly get subjective I am going to attempt to make it as objective as I possibly can using information that is publically available.
